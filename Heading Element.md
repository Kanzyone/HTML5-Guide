# Heading Elements

HTML is a markup language. We mark a content using an HTML tag and the browser render it to a clean web page. The h1 tag means making a text to be a large font size text, by default it creates 32px size text. We have h1 to h6 different tags to write different font size title. Pixel(px) is a unit to measure size which is as small as a dot.

```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>30 Days Of HTML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>First level heading</h1>
    <h2>Second level heading</h2>
    <h3>Third level heading</h3>
    <h1>Fourth level heading</h1>
    <h4>Fifth level heading</h4>
    <h6>Sixth level heading</h6>
  </body>
</html>
```

The size of the h1 to h6 tags:
* h1 is 32px (2em)
* h2 is 24px (1.5em)
* h3 is 20.8px (1.3em)
* h4 is 16px (1em)
* h5 is 12.8px (0.8em)
* h6 is 11.2px (0.7em)
