<h1>Setting Development Environment</h1>

<h2>Browser</h2>

There are many browsers out there but most developers prefer to use Google Chrome or FireFox. I usually use Google chrome for development and I recommend it too. <a href="https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChsSEwid-qOt7caQAxWDU38AHT74KZsYACICCAEQARoCb2E&co=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMInfqjre3GkAMVg1N_AB0--SsnH8EzLaU85Of6v5vdZhfwHc2qzEqenBE7EBwibV1JKUQENe0ifVJLUKoub5e0HsKrt98e1viJNEAUTM8cZ1gQ95aJzBSHEHKU8iv0vby0M0zeZOgy-Brvj2w-UWdpunvrMj77EbAmbHZuvrU81SrEGwPuYzMh5dBmIKQN7XgqM5g63Gmf2HRNCmoEgTXhJtGO2dGou3d&cce=1&sig=AOD64_1jmEVdKRpamXAvGKVCTmM722-qaQ&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjmh5-t7caQAxV44ckDHbkNDLYQ0Qx6BAgWEAE" title="Google site" target="_blank"> Download Google Chrome </a> if you do not have one.

HTML supports many browsers such as Safari, Opera, FireFox, Edge and Google Chrome. So I don't think so you will be have any problem for browser.

## Code Editor

As web developer, you should write code using a text or code editor. Therefore, to write HTML code, CSS, JS, React or other you need to have a code edit.

I will use Visual studio code and I will use it in this challenge too. I strongly suggest to use Visual Studio Code because it has lots of productivity extensions that makes super productive. Now, let's [download visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

# Introduction of HTML

HTML is used to build the skeleton or outline of any website. The skeleton or outline of the website is styled(beautified) by CSS(Cascading Style Sheet). JavaScript (JS) can make a website interactive and dynamic. HTML, CSS and JS are the core technologies to build websites and these are the skills required to be a web developer. This challenge will focus on HTML but we will use little CSS to make some HTML concepts more clear to the readers.

## What is HTML?

The word HTML is an acronym. That is stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup languages to develop websites. HTML is the build block of the web that allows building layouts of page using HTML elements. HTML is not not a programming language instead it is a markup language.
HTML code will be rendered by a browser and it give a human readable output. Look at the figure bellow to understand better how the HTML code convert to a website using a browser.
