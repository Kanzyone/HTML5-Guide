<h1>Setting Development Environment</h1>

<h2>Browser</h2>

There are many browsers out there but most developers prefer to use Google Chrome or FireFox. I usually use Google chrome for development and I recommend it too. <a href="https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChsSEwid-qOt7caQAxWDU38AHT74KZsYACICCAEQARoCb2E&co=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMInfqjre3GkAMVg1N_AB0--SsnH8EzLaU85Of6v5vdZhfwHc2qzEqenBE7EBwibV1JKUQENe0ifVJLUKoub5e0HsKrt98e1viJNEAUTM8cZ1gQ95aJzBSHEHKU8iv0vby0M0zeZOgy-Brvj2w-UWdpunvrMj77EbAmbHZuvrU81SrEGwPuYzMh5dBmIKQN7XgqM5g63Gmf2HRNCmoEgTXhJtGO2dGou3d&cce=1&sig=AOD64_1jmEVdKRpamXAvGKVCTmM722-qaQ&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjmh5-t7caQAxV44ckDHbkNDLYQ0Qx6BAgWEAE" title="Google site" target="_blank"> Download Google Chrome </a> if you do not have one.

HTML supports many browsers such as Safari, Opera, FireFox, Edge and Google Chrome. So I don't think so you will be have any problem for browser.

## Code Editor

As web developer, you should write code using a text or code editor. Therefore, to write HTML code, CSS, JS, React or other you need to have a code edit.

I will use Visual studio code and I will use it in this challenge too. I strongly suggest to use Visual Studio Code because it has lots of productivity extensions that makes super productive. Now, let's [download visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
