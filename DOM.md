# DOM

In this section, we will start writing the DOM tree of an HTML document or file. DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM is structure like a true. It starts with an html root element followed by head and body. The head and the body are the immediate children of the root element, html. Before the root element, there is a declaration.

## Declaration

Before the root element, there is a declaration. This declaration tells the browser that the document is an HTML. Therefore, the browser render it to the way an HTML suppose to be rendered.
This is the code to declare an HTML. The declaration is not part of the DOM tree.

Basicly, it shows that you use HTML 5 version.
