# HTML5 Guide
This learning guide is designed for beginners who want to start learning web development or refresh their knowledge of HTML. It follows a structured format, progressing through chapters (Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, â€¦) and each focusing on a specific topic. The goal is not just to memorize HTML tags, but to understand the logic behind them and learn by doing.

Each chapter includes: a short and clear explanation of the topic, code examples with real use cases, small exercises to practice and a quick summary at the end.

By following this guide, you will: understand the basic structure of a web page, learn the most commonly used HTML tags, discover how to properly use elements like forms, tables, links, and media and eventually build your own simple web pages.

At the end of the guide, youâ€™ll also find a final project to put everything youâ€™ve learned into practice!ðŸš€

You can progress through each chapter at your own pace - all you need is a text editor and a web browser. 


# Setting Development Environment

## Browser

There are many browsers out there but most developers prefer to use Google Chrome or FireFox. I usually use Google chrome for development and I recommend it too. [Download Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChsSEwid-qOt7caQAxWDU38AHT74KZsYACICCAEQARoCb2E&co=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMInfqjre3GkAMVg1N_AB0--CmbEAAYASAAEgKKl_D_BwE&cid=CAASrwHkaII3ZMF-FQtj7NYNIUdSqIgPygmV-RSsnH8EzLaU85Of6v5vdZhfwHc2qzEqenBE7EBwibV1JKUQENe0ifVJLUKoub5e0HsKrt98e1viJNEAUTM8cZ1gQ95aJzBSHEHKU8iv0vby0M0zeZOgy-Brvj2w-UWdpunvrMj77EbAmbHZuvrU81SrEGwPuYzMh5dBmIKQN7XgqM5g63Gmf2HRNCmoEgTXhJtGO2dGou3d&cce=1&sig=AOD64_1jmEVdKRpamXAvGKVCTmM722-qaQ&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjmh5-t7caQAxV44ckDHbkNDLYQ0Qx6BAgWEAE) if you do not have one.

HTML supports many browsers such as Safari, Opera, FireFox, Edge and Google Chrome. So I don't think so you will be have any problem for browser.

## Code Editor

As web developer, you should write code using a text or code editor. Therefore, to write HTML code, CSS, JS, React or other you need to have a code edit.

I will use Visual studio code and I will use it in this challenge too. I strongly suggest to use Visual Studio Code because it has lots of productivity extensions that makes super productive. Now, let's [download visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
