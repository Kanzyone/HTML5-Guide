<h1>HTML Foundations</h1>

<p>
This guide is built to help beginners take their first step into web development and strengthen their understanding of HTML fundamentals.
</p>

<p>
By following this guide, you will: understand the basic structure of a web page, learn the most commonly used HTML tags, discover how to properly use elements like forms, tables, links, and media and eventually build your own simple web pages.
</p>

<p>
I created this guide because I noticed that there aren’t many clear and beginner resources for people who want to start learning frontend development. When I started developing and learning about web development, I couldn't find the kind of resources I wanted, so I decided to create my own resource using information from other sources and what I had learned myself.
</p>

<p>
Not only did this prove very helpful to me during my learning process, but I also hoped others could benefit from it. Many people are interested in web development but don’t know where or how to begin. Although HTML is the foundation of everything in frontend, most tutorials are either too complex or poorly structured, which can make learning overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
With this guide, my goal is to provide a simple, structured, and hands on starting point for anyone who wants to step into the world of frontend development. I believe the best part of this guide is that it encourages learning by doing, helping you understand the building blocks of HTML and gain the confidence to create your own web pages!
</p>

<br>

<p>
This guide was created with the idea that understanding the fundamentals is more important than memorizing tags.
Instead of only listing elements, the goal was to explain how HTML is structured, how the DOM is formed,
and how browsers read and interpret web pages.

  <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
</div>
<p>
This section provides a general overview of the web and introduces the basic concepts needed to begin learning web development.
Before diving into HTML, it is important to understand what the web is, how it works, and how different parts of a website are connected.
</p>

<p>
In the following topics, you will explore the structure of the web, how browsers and servers communicate, and the role of frontend
and backend technologies in building modern websites. This foundation will help you better understand how HTML fits into the bigger picture.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Web</h2>
<p>
The web, also known as the World Wide Web (WWW), is a global system that allows people to access and share information through the internet.
It is made up of millions of websites that can be opened and viewed using a web browser such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
</p>

<p>
Every website you visit, every image you see, and every video you watch online is part of the web.
Websites are created using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they are stored on servers that can be accessed from anywhere in the world. In simple terms, the web is a collection of connected pages and resources that people can explore through browsers.
It allows users to read content, watch videos, communicate, learn, and interact with online services.
</p>

<p>
Websites are built using frontend and backend technologies. The frontend is what users see and interact with,
while the backend handles data processing, storage, and server side logic.
</p>

<h3>How the Web Works</h3>
<p>By now you should have clear understanding how the web works based on the information you get on the above two sections. If you want to know more you may also read this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works">article</a>.</p>
<h3>Frontend Web Development</h3>
<p>
The frontend, also known as client-side development, is the part of a website that users can see and interact with directly.
It represents everything that appears in the browser when you visit a website.
</p>

<p>
All visible elements such as colors, fonts, buttons, images, videos, audio, layouts, and text content are part of the frontend.
In simple terms, anything you can see or interact with on a webpage belongs to the frontend.
</p>

<p>
The technologies used to build the frontend of a website are called <strong>frontend technologies</strong>.
The core technologies used to create the frontend are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML</strong> – Builds the structure of the page</li>
  <li><strong>CSS</strong> – Styles and designs the page</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> – Makes the page interactive and dynamic</li>
</ul>

<h3>Backend Web Development</h3>
<p>
Backend development, also known as server-side development, refers to the processes that happen behind the scenes of a website.
Unlike the frontend, which users can see and interact with, the backend handles data processing, application logic, and communication
with databases. A typical backend system consists of a server, a backend programming language, and a database. The backend communicates with the
frontend and manages data using programming languages such as Node.js, Python, Ruby, or PHP.
</p>

<p>
When a user interacts with a website, the browser (client) sends an HTTP request to the server. The backend processes this request,
interacts with the database if necessary, and then returns an HTTP response back to the client. This response can be an HTML page,
text, an image, or other types of data.
</p>

<p>
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the communication protocol that allows data to be transferred between the client and the server.
It is the foundation of communication on the web and enables browsers and web servers to exchange information.
</p>

<h3>Fullstack Web Development</h3>
<p>
Full-stack web development refers to working with both the frontend and backend parts of a web application.
A full-stack developer is someone who understands how the entire system works, from the user interface to the server and database. In simple terms, full-stack development can be seen as the combination of multiple areas, including frontend development,
backend development, testing, and sometimes additional tools and technologies used to build and maintain modern web applications.
</p>

<p>
By learning both client-side and server-side technologies, full-stack developers gain a broader understanding of how websites function
as complete systems.
</p>

<h3>Parts of a Website</h3>
<p>
A website can have a few features or many features depending on its purpose. There is no strict rule that defines what every
website must include. However, most modern websites share a number of common components. For example, the very first website ever created had only one simple page with a few links. Since 1993, HTML has continued to evolve,
and today it is possible to build a complete and decent static website using only HTML.
</p>

<p>
Below are some of the most common parts (components) that you will often find in many websites:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Website Logo</li>
  <li>Header / Banner</li>
  <li>Navigation Bar / Menu</li>
  <li>Carousel or Slider</li>
  <li>Content Sections</li>
  <li>Forms</li>
  <li>Buttons</li>
  <li>Links</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>Videos</li>
  <li>Audio</li>
  <li>Social Media Links</li>
  <li>Footer</li>
</ul>

<p>
When you build a website, you will create many of these components using HTML. Once a component is created,
it can often be reused in different projects. This is why it is important to think about maintainability
and reusability while developing web pages.
</p>

<p>
You do not need to include all of these components in every website. The structure and features of a website
depend on its purpose, content, and design goals. There are no strict rules about what must be included.
</p>


<h2>Setting Development Environment</h2>

<p>
Before writing HTML code, you need to prepare a simple development environment. This includes choosing a web browser to view your
pages and a code editor to write and manage your code.
</p>

<p>
Having the right tools makes the learning process easier and more productive. In this section, you will learn which browser to use,
which code editor to install, and how to set up your workspace for web development.
</p>

<h3>Browser</h3>

<p>
There are many web browsers available, but most developers prefer to use Google Chrome or Firefox for development.
I personally use Google Chrome and highly recommend it.
<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" title="Download Google Chrome" target="_blank">
  Download Google Chrome
</a>
if you do not have it installed.
</p>

<p>
HTML is supported by all modern browsers, including Safari, Opera, Firefox, Edge, and Google Chrome.
Therefore, you should not face any issues viewing HTML pages in any standard browser.
</p>

<h3>Code Editor</h3>

<p>
As a web developer, you should write and manage your code using a text or code editor. To create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files,
you need a reliable and easy-to-use editor.
</p>

<p>
In this guide, we will use Visual Studio Code. It is one of the most popular code editors because it is lightweight,
powerful, and has many useful extensions that improve productivity.
You can download it here:
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">
  Download Visual Studio Code
</a>.
</p>

<h3>How to use Visual Studio Code</h3>

<p>
If you are new to Visual Studio Code, you can learn the basics by watching the following video:
<a href="https://youtu.be/cu_ykIfBprI?si=_2-PMfP3MGc6OUKs" target="_blank">
  Watch tutorial video
</a>.
</p>

<br>
<h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>

<p>
HTML is used to build the structure (skeleton) of every website. This structure is styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets),
and JavaScript (JS) is used to make websites interactive and dynamic.
</p>

<p>
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies of web development. These are the essential skills required to become
a web developer. This guide will mainly focus on HTML, but in some sections, small amounts of CSS may be used to make certain
concepts easier to understand.
</p>

<h3>What is HTML?</h3>

<p>
HTML is an acronym that stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It is the standard markup language used to create
web pages and structure their content.
</p>

<p>
HTML is the building block of the web. It allows developers to create the layout of a page using elements such as headings,
paragraphs, images, links, and more.
</p>

<p>
HTML is not a programming language. Instead, it is a markup language that describes the structure of content on a webpage.
When a browser reads HTML code, it renders it and displays a human-readable web page.
</p>

<p>
Look at the figure below to better understand how HTML code is converted into a visible web page by a browser.
</p>
