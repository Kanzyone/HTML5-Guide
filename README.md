# HTML5 Guide
This learning guide is designed for beginners who want to start learning web development or refresh their knowledge of HTML. It follows a structured format, progressing through chapters (Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, â€¦) and each focusing on a specific topic. The goal is not just to memorize HTML tags, but to understand the logic behind them and learn by doing.

Each chapter includes: a short and clear explanation of the topic, code examples with real use cases, small exercises to practice and a quick summary at the end.

By following this guide, you will: understand the basic structure of a web page, learn the most commonly used HTML tags, discover how to properly use elements like forms, tables, links, and media and eventually build your own simple web pages.

At the end of the guide, youâ€™ll also find a final project to put everything youâ€™ve learned into practice!ðŸš€

You can progress through each chapter at your own pace - all you need is a text editor and a web browser.
